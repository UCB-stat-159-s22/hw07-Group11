## Welcome to HW 7

## Credit Account Default Status and Characteristics

**[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/UCB-stat-159-s22/hw07-Group11/HEAD?labpath=main.ipynb)**

Note that Binder runs and generates the each plot inside the output folder, but does not generate the packages-related plots within the notebook. This can be solved by setting up and running the notebook locally, but you can still check each plot in the output folder.

**Note:** This repository is public. The [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mishra5001/credit-card?datasetId=263888&select=columns_description.csv) is from Kaggle. The EDA and Logistic Regression model were developed by Joe, Isaac, and Uma as a homework assignment for the [Spring 2022 installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, _Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science](https://ucb-stat-159-s22.github.io).
