## Authors Contribution

Joe: Joe added to Uma's initial version of EDA, serialized the data and intermediate results, created the functions(plotting and logistic regression) and the tools packages, added docstrings and tests for the functions and also wrote texts on the methods and analysis for the notebook.


Uma: Uma began the EDA and wrote the backup code towards the end(deleted for cleanness of the final versions but can be found on earlier versions of the notebook). She also wrote the initial code for the logistic regression modeling as well as set up the binder link.


Isaac: Isaac created the environment fiels as well as initiated the building of the hw7_tools library and the inital tests. He also turned the repo into a jupyter-book that can be viewed on GitHub Pages.
